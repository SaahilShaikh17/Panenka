In fact, they were the only Premier League side that not yet tasted defeat at the impressive arena. And as Saturday's match entered the 96th minute, Jurgen Klopp must have thought that his team were about to maintain that record, despite everything that had been thrown at them over the course of the evening."

        desc: "So much for Manchester United's revival. After a slender win at Burnley and a convincing Carabao Cup victory over Crystal Palace, Erik ten Hag's side are right back to square one after a limp 1-0 defeat at home to Palace. A deflected Joachim Andersen goal in the first half proved the difference but what was most concerning was United's severe lack of attacking spark. And the blame must fall on Marcus Rashford, who had a really poor game once more and could be in danger of losing his place to Alejandro Garnacho if he keeps this dire form up."
